# Claims Management Issues - Quick Reference

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Multiple Claims on Same Policy
**Before**: Users could claim the same policy multiple times, draining the pool incorrectly.

**After**: 
- Backend checks if policy has already been claimed
- `payoutTriggered` flag set to `true` after first claim
- Frontend validates status before allowing claim submission
- Clear error message: "This policy has already been claimed"

### ✅ Issue 2: Disconnected Pool Management
**Before**: Insurance pool (premiums) and claims pool were separate, causing confusion.

**After**:
- Unified pool management in `claimsPool` table
- Premiums automatically added when policies are synced
- Claims automatically deducted from same pool
- Formula: `availableBalance = totalCapacity - totalClaimsProcessed`

### ✅ Issue 3: Mock Frontend Data
**Before**: Frontend showed decreasing balances but no real database updates.

**After**:
- All changes persist to PostgreSQL database
- Real-time pool status from API
- Accurate tracking of:
  - Total Capacity (premiums collected)
  - Available Balance (remaining funds)
  - Total Claims Processed (sum of payouts)

## What Changed

### Backend Files
1. `backend/policy-service/src/sync-policies.ts`
   - Added premium to claimsPool when syncing policies

2. `backend/claims-service/src/routes/claims.ts`
   - Added duplicate claim prevention
   - Mark policies as claimed after payout
   - Better error messages

### Frontend Files
3. `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
   - Client-side duplicate claim check
   - Improved UI for claimed policies
   - Better error handling and messages

## Current Status

**Working ✅**
- Duplicate claim prevention
- Unified pool tracking (premiums + claims)
- Real database persistence
- Policy status management
- Frontend/backend sync

**Not Yet Implemented ⚠️**
- Actual HBAR transfers to user wallets
- Requires Hedera SDK integration (see CLAIMS_MANAGEMENT_FIX.md)

## Testing

To verify fixes:

1. **Test Duplicate Prevention**
   ```bash
   # Submit claim for policy ID 2
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/v1/claims/create \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"policyId":2,"policyholder":"0xa3f3599f3B375F95125c4d9402140c075F733D8e","amount":10}'
   
   # Try again - should fail
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/v1/claims/create \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"policyId":2,"policyholder":"0xa3f3599f3B375F95125c4d9402140c075F733D8e","amount":10}'
   ```

2. **Check Pool Balance**
   ```bash
   # View current pool status
   curl http://localhost:3003/api/v1/claims/pool/status
   ```

3. **Check Policy Status**
   ```bash
   # View policies (payoutTriggered should be true for claimed policies)
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/policies
   ```
