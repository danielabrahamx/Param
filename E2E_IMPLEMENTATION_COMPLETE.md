## How to Run

### Quick Start
```bash
cd backend/e2e-tests
npm install
npm test
```

### Individual Tests
```bash
npm run test:pool       # Test pool funding
npm run test:policy     # Test policy purchase
npm run test:oracle     # Test oracle monitoring
npm run test:threshold  # Test threshold adjustment
npm run test:claim      # Test claim payout
```

### Using PowerShell Script
```bash
cd backend/e2e-tests
./run-tests.ps1
```

## Prerequisites

1. ✓ Backend services running (`docker-compose up -d`)
2. ✓ Smart contracts deployed to Hedera testnet
3. ✓ Environment variables configured in `backend/.env`
4. ✓ Admin wallet funded with ≥10 HBAR

## Success Criteria

When tests pass, you'll see:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║            ✓ ALL TESTS PASSED!                       ║
║  The Param insurance system is working correctly!    ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
