## Backend Integration Status

### ✅ Connected & Configured
```
Frontend → API Gateway (localhost:3000)
         ├→ Policy Service (localhost:3001)
         ├→ Oracle Service (localhost:3002)
         └→ Claims Service (localhost:3003)
```

### API Endpoints Being Used
1. **Policy Service:**
   - `GET /api/v1/policies` - Fetch user policies
   
2. **Oracle Service:**
   - `GET /api/v1/oracle/flood-level/:regionId` - Get flood level
   
3. **Claims Service:**
   - `GET /api/v1/claims` - Fetch claims
   - `POST /api/v1/claims/:id/review` - Review/approve claims

4. **Pool Service:**
   - `GET /api/v1/pool` - Get pool stats

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Next Steps

### For Testing Backend APIs:
1. **Flood Level API** - Returns mock data currently
2. **Claims API** - Database schema needs validation
3. **Policies API** - Needs backend implementation
4. **Pool API** - Needs backend implementation

### For Contract Interaction:
1. **Local Hardhat Node** - Need to deploy contracts first
2. **RPC Connection** - Currently set to localhost:8545
3. **Network Configuration** - Set to use local network

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Deploy contracts** to local Hardhat node or testnet
2. **Implement backend endpoints** to return real data from database
3. **Test wallet connection** with MetaMask on testnet
4. **Run end-to-end tests** - Connect wallet → Buy insurance → View claims
5. **Validate contract calls** from frontend

---

## How to Test

### 1. Start Everything
```bash
# Terminal 1: Frontend (already running on 5177)
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Backend services
cd backend
docker compose up -d

# Terminal 3: Smart contracts (local node)
cd contracts
npx hardhat node
```

### 2. Deploy Contracts
```bash
cd contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
# Update addresses in frontend/.env with deployed addresses
```

### 3. Test in Browser
Visit `http://localhost:5177` and:
1. Connect wallet (requires MetaMask)
2. Navigate between all pages
3. Try buying insurance (will fail until contracts deployed)
4. Check dashboard for flood level and policies
5. View claims and pool information
