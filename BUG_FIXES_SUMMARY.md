# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Claim Payout Button Not Responding**

**Root Cause:**
The "Claim Payout Now" button was only visible when `isCritical && !selectedPolicy.payoutTriggered` was true. This meant:
- The button would only show when flood level exceeded the CRITICAL threshold
- Many users couldn't access the button at all, especially during testing with adjusted thresholds

**Solution:**
- Changed the button condition to show whenever `!selectedPolicy.payoutTriggered` (claim hasn't been made yet)
- Added a `disabled` state when `!isRisky` (flood level below warning threshold)
- Button now provides visual feedback (grayed out with tooltip) when conditions aren't met
- Users can now attempt to claim as soon as flood risk is detected

**Changed Code:**
```tsx
// BEFORE:
{isCritical && !selectedPolicy.payoutTriggered && (
  <button onClick={() => handleClaimPayout(selectedPolicy)}>
    💰 Claim Payout Now
  </button>
)}

// AFTER:
{!selectedPolicy.payoutTriggered && (
  <button
    onClick={() => handleClaimPayout(selectedPolicy)}
    disabled={!isRisky}
    className={`... ${
      isRisky
        ? 'bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white cursor-pointer'
        : 'bg-gray-300 text-gray-500 cursor-not-allowed'
    }`}
    title={isRisky ? 'Submit claim for payout' : 'Flood level must exceed warning threshold to claim'}
  >
    💰 Claim Payout Now
  </button>
)}
```

### 2. **Threshold Resets After Page Reload**

**Root Cause:**
Threshold values (`criticalThreshold` and `warningThreshold`) were stored only in React component state with hardcoded defaults:
```tsx
const [criticalThreshold, setCriticalThreshold] = useState(1500)
const [warningThreshold, setWarningThreshold] = useState(1000)
```
When users adjusted thresholds and reloaded the page, they would lose all changes and revert to defaults.

**Solution:**
- Implemented localStorage persistence for both threshold values
- Used React state initializer functions to load saved values on component mount
- Added useEffect hooks to automatically save to localStorage whenever values change
- Users can now adjust thresholds, reload, and settings persist

**Changed Code:**
```tsx
// BEFORE:
const [criticalThreshold, setCriticalThreshold] = useState(1500)
const [warningThreshold, setWarningThreshold] = useState(1000)

// AFTER:
const [criticalThreshold, setCriticalThreshold] = useState(() => {
  const stored = localStorage.getItem('criticalThreshold')
  return stored ? Number(stored) : 1500
})
const [warningThreshold, setWarningThreshold] = useState(() => {
  const stored = localStorage.getItem('warningThreshold')
  return stored ? Number(stored) : 1000
})

// Persist thresholds to localStorage whenever they change
useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('criticalThreshold', criticalThreshold.toString())
}, [criticalThreshold])

useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('warningThreshold', warningThreshold.toString())
}, [warningThreshold])
```

## Testing Steps

### To Test Claim Payout Fix:
1. Open Dashboard
2. Adjust the warning threshold to a low value (e.g., 100) to simulate flood
3. Click "View Details" on a policy
4. The "Claim Payout Now" button should now be **enabled and green** (previously would not appear)
5. Click the button to submit a claim
6. Should see success alert: "✅ Claim submitted! Claim ID: {id}"

### To Test Threshold Persistence:
1. Open Dashboard
2. Click "⚙️ Configure" next to the flood level monitor
3. Change the Critical Threshold to a different value (e.g., 2000)
4. Change the Warning Threshold (e.g., 1500)
5. Click "✓ Done"
6. **Reload the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
7. The values should **persist** - your custom thresholds should still be there
8. Status indicators and alert logic should use the saved values

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Added localStorage persistence and fixed button condition

## Browser Storage
- **Storage Key 1:** `criticalThreshold` (stored as string)
- **Storage Key 2:** `warningThreshold` (stored as string)
- Location: Browser's localStorage (specific to domain, persists across sessions)

---

## Notes
- The fixes are client-side only; no backend changes needed
- Thresholds are now client-specific (each browser/device stores independently)
- If a user clears their browser cache/storage, thresholds will reset to defaults
- The claim payout backend endpoint (`POST /api/v1/claims/create`) requires that flood level > warning threshold for the backend to process
