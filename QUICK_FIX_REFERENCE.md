# Quick Fix Reference

## What Was Broken
1. ❌ Clicking "Claim Payout Now" button did nothing (button wasn't even visible most of the time)
2. ❌ Adjusting flood threshold values reset to defaults on page reload

## What's Fixed
1. ✅ **Claim Payout Button Now Works**
   - Button appears when payout hasn't been claimed yet
   - Button is enabled (green) when flood level exceeds warning threshold
   - Button is disabled (grayed out) when conditions aren't met
   - Clicking it successfully submits a claim

2. ✅ **Thresholds Now Persist Across Reloads**
   - Adjust thresholds via "⚙️ Configure" button
   - Values automatically save to browser storage
   - Reload the page - your custom values remain!

## How to Test

### Test 1: Claim Payout (Quick)
```
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "⚙️ Configure" → Set Critical Threshold to 100
3. Click "✓ Done"
4. Click "View Details" on any policy
5. "Claim Payout Now" button should be GREEN and clickable
6. Click it → See "✅ Claim submitted!" alert
```

### Test 2: Threshold Persistence (Quick)
```
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "⚙️ Configure"
3. Change Critical to 2500, Warning to 2000
4. Click "✓ Done"
5. Press F5 (refresh page)
6. Click "⚙️ Configure" again
7. Values should still be 2500 and 2000 ✓
```

## Technical Details

**File Changed:** `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- Added localStorage to store threshold values
- Modified button logic from `isCritical` to `isRisky` condition
- Thresholds load on mount and auto-save on change

**Browser Support:** All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**Before:** "Why doesn't the button work? The threshold keeps resetting!" 😤
**After:** "Finally works! Values actually save now!" ✨
